## Project Requirements

1. Create a Rails API with one model
2. Create a separate HTML/CSS/JS application that loads an index.html file
3. Using AJAX, display a list of all of the items in your database
4. Create a form that, when submitted, will create a new instance of your model in your API's database and display in the list on your view without refreshing the page.
